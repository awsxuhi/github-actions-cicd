## Step 1: generate the summary for each file (based on its changes)

Right after doSummary()
Printing inputs.rawSummary (1. initial value), => It's "", empty string.

Printing inputs.rawSummary (2. new value) , the result is as follows:

.github/actions/ai-codereviewer/action.yml: Here is a 100-word summary of the provided Pull Request:

The Pull Request titled "Dev" is a test change. The description indicates this is a test, with no further details provided. The diff shows a change to the default value of the "REVIEW_MAX_COMMENTS" input, increasing it from "5" to "10". This change would affect the maximum number of comments included in a review per diff. No other changes to exported functions, global data structures, variables, or the external interface or behavior of the code are noted.

.github/actions/aws-genai-codereview/src/doc/stepsOfSummarization.md: Here is a 100-word summary of the provided Pull Request:

The Pull Request titled "Dev" is a test that includes changes to generate a summary for each file based on its changes, concatenate the summaries into a longer string, and further summarize the content using a large language model. The final summary is generated by combining the walkthrough and changes sections, and a short summary is also provided. The changes do not appear to alter the signatures of exported functions, global data structures, or variables, nor do they seem to affect the external interface or behavior of the code.
---
.github/actions/aws-genai-codereview/src/lib/doReview.ts: Here is a 100-word summary of the provided Pull Request:

The Pull Request is a test with no significant changes. The main change is the addition of a `printWithColor()` function call to log the prompt used for the `renderReviewFileDiff()` function. This function is called to generate a response from the `heavyBot` using the provided prompt. The response is then checked, and if it is empty, a failure is recorded in the `reviewContext.reviewsFailed` array. There are no alterations to the signatures of exported functions, global data structures, or variables, and the external interface or behavior of the code remains unchanged.

.github/actions/aws-genai-codereview/src/review.ts: Here is a 100-word summary of the Pull Request:

This is a test Pull Request. The changes include updates to the `codeReview` function, which generates a summary of the changes in a Pull Request. The summary is generated in multiple steps:

1. Summarize each file's changes individually.
2. Combine the individual file summaries into a single summary.
3. Generate a final summary of the overall changes.
4. Generate release notes based on the changes.
5. Generate a short summary.

The changes do not appear to alter the signatures of exported functions, global data structures, or variables, and should not affect the external interface or behavior of the code.

.github/actions/aws-genai-codereview/src/utils/debugPrintCommitSha.ts: Here is a 100-word summary of the provided Pull Request:

The Pull Request titled "Dev" is a test change. The description indicates this is a test, with no further details provided. The code diff shows a change to the `debugPrintCommitSha` function, where the label for the `newHeadSha` parameter has been updated to indicate it is the current commit from the `context.payload.after` value. No other changes to function signatures, global data structures, or external interfaces are noted. Overall, this appears to be a minor change for testing purposes, with no significant impact on the codebase.

Provided below (<changeSet> tag) are changesets in this pull request.
Changesets are in chronlogical order and new changesets are appended to the end of the list. The format consists of filename(s) and the summary of changes for those files. There is a separator between each changeset.
Your task is to deduplicate and group together files with related/similar changes into a single changeset. Respond with the updated changesets using the same format as the input.

Your task is to provide a concise summary of the changes.
This summary will be used as a prompt while reviewing each file and must be very clear for the AI bot to understand.

Instructions:

- Focus on summarizing only the changes in the PR and stick to the facts.
- Do not provide any instructions to the bot on how to perform the review.
- Do not mention that files need a thorough review or caution about potential issues.
- Do not mention that these changes affect the logic or functionality of the code.
- The summary should not exceed a 500-word limit.
```

Printing Step 5, summarizeShortResponse <review.ts:206>

```
Here is a concise summary of the changes in the Pull Request:

The Pull Request titled "Dev" includes test changes and updates related to code review summarization functionality. The main changes are:

1. Increase the default value of the "REVIEW_MAX_COMMENTS" input in the .github/actions/ai-codereviewer/action.yml file from 5 to 10. This change affects the maximum number of comments included in a review per diff.

2. Updates to the codeReview function in .github/actions/aws-genai-codereview/src/review.ts to generate summaries of changes in a Pull Request. The function now includes steps to summarize each file's changes individually, combine individual file summaries into a single summary, generate a final summary of overall changes, generate release notes based on changes, and generate a short summary.

3. Addition of a new file .github/actions/aws-genai-codereview/src/doc/stepsOfSummarization.md, which likely documents the steps involved in the summarization process.

4. Updates to .github/actions/aws-genai-codereview/src/lib/doReview.ts to log prompts used for generating responses.

5. Updates to .github/actions/aws-genai-codereview/src/utils/debugPrintCommitSha.ts to update parameter labels.

The changes appear to be focused on enhancing the code review summarization functionality and testing purposes, without altering the signatures of exported functions, global data structures, or variables, or affecting the external interface or behavior of the code.
